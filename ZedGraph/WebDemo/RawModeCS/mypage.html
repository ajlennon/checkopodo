         Here is an ordinary HTML page that includes some html tags,
         plus a ZedGraphWeb control rendered in RawImage mode.<br />
         In raw mode the image is generated and sent to the browser on the fly
         (right click the image, select properties and look at the URL).<br /><br />
         
         <img src="mygraph.aspx" alt="Sales By Region" /><br /><br />
           
         Of course, you can place other items on the page as well.
