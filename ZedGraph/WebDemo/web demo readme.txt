The Web demos each require that you copy zedgraph.dll and zedgraph.web.dll
into the bin directory.

The demos include a RawImage and ImageTag render mode sample in C#. Both of these
are setup for .Net 2.0 syntax, and work with Visual Web Developer Express 2005.

A third .Net 2.0 demo for visual basic is included that demonstrates both
RawImage and ImageTag mode under VB.
